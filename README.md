This program solves 2D transient Navier-Stokes Equations using the SIMPLE algorithm and Fictitious Domain / Immersed Boundary method.  

See the following papers for more details:

A new implicit fictitious domain method for the simulation of flow in complex geometries with heat transfer
S Haeri, JS Shrimpton, Journal of Computational Physics 237, 21-45.

On the application of immersed boundary, fictitious domain and body-conformal mesh methods to many particle multiphase flows
S Haeri, JS Shrimpton, International Journal of Multiphase Flow 40, 38-55.

A correlation for the calculation of the local Nusselt number around circular cylinders in the range 10 ⩽ Re ⩽ 250 and 0.1 ⩽ Pr ⩽ 40
S Haeri, JS Shrimpton, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 59, 219-229.

A Makefile is provided to build the program. The program has been tested on several systems however note that this is only distributed in a hope to be useful for learning fixed mesh approaches in CFD. I am not developing this code actively anymore and you may find some redundant features or a poor documentation. If you need some test cases to try the Software or had any problems feel free to contact me through
