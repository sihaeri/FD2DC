This program solves 2D transient Navier-Stokes Equations using the SIMPLE algorithm and Fictitious Domain / Immersed Boundary method.  

See the following papers for more details:

A new implicit fictitious domain method for the simulation of flow in complex geometries with heat transfer
S Haeri, JS Shrimpton, Journal of Computational Physics 237, 21-45.

On the application of immersed boundary, fictitious domain and body-conformal mesh methods to many particle multiphase flows
S Haeri, JS Shrimpton, International Journal of Multiphase Flow 40, 38-55.

A correlation for the calculation of the local Nusselt number around circular cylinders in the range 10 ⩽ Re ⩽ 250 and 0.1 ⩽ Pr ⩽ 40
S Haeri, JS Shrimpton, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 59, 219-229.

A Makefile is provided to build the program. The program has been tested on several systems however note that this is only distributed in a hope to be useful for learning fixed mesh approaches in CFD. If you need some test cases to try the Software or had any problems feel free to email me at s.haeri@ed.ac.uk
